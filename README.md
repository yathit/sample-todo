===========

YDN-DB javascript database library is abstraction layer for multiple storage mechanisms, including [IndexedDB](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/), [Web SQL database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_SQL_Database) and [WebStorage](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/) (localStorage). On top of that, ydn-db provides ORM like query capability.

The first thing you need to think using database is its schema. A database in IndexedDB, and hence YDN-DB, are composed of several Object Stores. You will create an object store for each type of data. Each Object Store can have a collection of Indexes that make it efficient to query and iterate across. Being key-document store, there is no relationship between object stores.

This sample application code demonstrate very simple use case of ynd-db library to build todo list manager similar to [HTML5Rocks todo list example](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/indexeddb/todo/). In this simple app, there is only one data type to store, the todo data. Each database record has a key and a value. The value is a simple javascript object. A [key](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#key-construct) could be number, string, Date or an array of these data types. For todo list app, we will use number generated by current timestamp. Date is generally avoid since it does not offer benefit over using number (timestamp), but complicate in range query.
